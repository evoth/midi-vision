## Inspiration
The singular inspiration for this project is a video titled [Bach Vision Test](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJfiOuDdetg), released by the band [Vulfpeck](https://vulfpeck.com), with visuals by [Rob Stenson](https://robstenson.com).

## Instructions
- **Warning:** This project is very bare-bones at the moment, so you might run into glitches.
- **Upload file:** Press the "Choose file" button (try to use a file with 4 tracks or less).
- **Play file:** Press the "Play file" button to start playing/visualizing the file.
- **Pause/stop:** As of now there are no controls for pausing/stopping, so just refresh the page.

## Todo
- Figure out where to put the various class definitions
- Type hinting?
- More comments (for classes and constructors)
- Change all "coords" things (2-length arrays) to actual point objects
- Improve performance
- Figure out weird delay
- Move functions to different places with actual parameters and arguments instead of having them inline
- CRACKLE
- replace forEach with let of for consistency
- Fix repeated notes
- "How it works" section of README
